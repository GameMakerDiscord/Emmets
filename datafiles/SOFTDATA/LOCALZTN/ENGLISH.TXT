[MARKERS]
welcome=Welcome to Emmets!##Since this is your first game, a few messages will be guiding you through learning the basics.##Emmets is a rogue-like MANAGEMENT game where the goal is to make a SUCCESSFUL MINING COMPANY.#To achieve this goal, you will have to :#- EXPLORE caves to find valuable minerals and resources#- SELL the resources on the market and compete against other companies##The game is connected to RackNet's server, and every other company you'll meet (and even some emmets!) originates from other players.##First things first, let's create your company.
quickstart=TUTORIAL##You start every exploration with a predeployed BATTERY. This battery can supply power to other buildings, which is essential. You're also going to need the following buildings :#- An UPLINKER to call emmets#- A REFINERY to convert raw materials into usable resources#- A SENDER to send refined resources to the station##You ALREADY HAVE those three buildings in stock. You can deploy them on the map by using the bottom left corner BUILD MENU.##Note : Be sure to CONNECT the buildings to the battery by putting them in contact.
emmets=TUTORIAL##Emmets are polyvalent units, able to drill walls, clear rubble and build pathways.#To put your emmets to work, you must give them OBJECTIVES. To create objectives, you can :#- Select a WALL and MARK IT TO DRILL.#- Select RUBBLE and MARK IT TO CLEAR##As soon as a marker is created, an emmet will automatically assign themself the task and do it.##You can also select any emmet manually by clicking on them, or by drawing a SELECTION RECTANGLE with your mouse around them.
oxygen=TUTORIAL##Your oxygen is very low.#It is time to exit the cave.##You can EXIT THE CAVE at any moment, by pressing the TOP RIGHT CORNER BUTTON on your screen.#Exiting the cave will SAFELY RECALL YOUR CREW MEMBERS, but any DEPLOYED BUILDING will be LOST.
stock=TUTORIAL##This is the MANAGE STOCKS screen.#Here, you can view and manage your stocked resources and buildings. This window also serves as a recap of everything you gathered during your exploration.#- Construction resources, like FUEL, METAL or JUNK are UNVALUABLE and will be lost in exchange of a small bonus.#- Other resources are VALUABLES and will be shown on this screen. Those are the resources you can sell on the market to make PROFIT.##If you stock too many resources or buildings, your STATION STORAGE CAPACITY will be OVERLOADED and you will have to waste resources to continue.#Station storage can be enhanced by UPGRADING THE STATION later on.##Once you've reviewed your stocks, you can continue.
sell=TUTORIAL##Welcome to EmmetsUnited - the marketplace.#The main point of this screen is to SELL VALUABLE RESOURCES at the highest possible price to make PROFIT. You can either sell everything now, or keep resources in stock and wait for the prices to go up.##From this screen, you can also see how other companies are doing, buy trainings for your emmets or buildings for your future explorations.

fuel=%s#Used by a power station to provide energy to other buildings
metal=%s#Used to build advanced buildings and structures
junk=%s#Used to build pathways and standard structures

adiamond=Each adamante ore conceals an unbreakable stone, made of a metal that melted in the planet's core itself. This kernel gives special properties to this material : in the dark, adamante nuggets show a reddish glow.#Primitive populations used to believe those cores contained mystic creatures, dragons or salamanders, ready to hatch.#As of today, this legend is nothing more than a spooky story a few emmets like to share during a break.

palladine=Palladine, once refined, can be treated and transformed into a liquid that blends with the blood of any living being. Once in contact with the palladine fluid, the organism mutates and develops superhuman capabilities.#The huge downside of this application is the addiction that comes with it : most people being unable to recover from even the slightest dose, palladine consumption is now heavily regulated and reserved for the army.

gauld=Unoptine is composed of millions of microscopic long crystals that give this material a shiny aspect. Like asbestos, unoptine used to be considered as a "miraculous" material. Its high tensile strength and heat resistance made unoptine widely used in various structures, as an insulation and/or construction material. Pure unoptine crystals being hard to find, the material was widely synthetised for common use.#Decades after its first synthetisation, the harmful health effects of unoptine were unveiled. Companies were created to handle the complete removal and destruction of all synthetised unoptine.#Pure unoptine however, was never shown to have any significant health impact : and therefore, is still used today for various purposes. 

kebelt=Kebelt takes its name from the first geologist who proved its existence, Ströma Kebelt. This famous scientist also gave her name to the court case that occured shortly after : the discovery was contested by another geologist, Andrio Deluel, claiming he discovered the material three years earlier. The case dragged on for a decade because of the lack of decisive proof.#Eventually, Deluel was considered the original discoverer of this element. But it was too late : the name "Kebelt" had been widely used for years. To this day, Deluel still militates for Kebelt to be called by its original name, "Deluelite".

terranniuxe="There has been no war before Terraniuxe : compared to it, any weapon of the past is merely a stick" said a famous commander.#Terraniuxe is used in state-of-the-art military equipment and sub-spatial long-range weapons. This material has mainly been extracted from the Tarydium mines for the past century. Recent reports revealed those exploitation sites were drying out, and those rumor created a fear of shortage which boosted Terraniuxe's prices.#It can be extracted from specific underground veins, but those only appear in precise geological conditions. 

copperine=Copperine has been mistaken for Copper for a very long time. The difference between the two materials was only discovered when off-world building companies tried to draw copper/ine lines in a rarefied atmosphere.#When exposed to such environment, copperine oxydizes in a special way : the surface covers itself in grey spikes. Those spikes, once formed, can be milled and treated to obtain another material, Copperade, which thermal conductivity is beyond record.#In industrial production, spikes are harvested in gigantic farms were multiple layers of metallic copperine are disposed on every field.

silverade=Naderinium is a chemical element found in low-depth rock formations. Called “Cloud Stone” by indigenous populations, it was believed to be the compound allowing clouds to fly. Naderinium is an incredibly light and flexible metal. Too fragile to be used as is, it is often melted and used to create alloys with heavier metals such as gold in order to create a robust yet usable material. Today, Naderinium is used in engineering and mechanics to create lighter vehicles capable of travelling at much higher speeds. 

oxygenite=Also known by its other name "Light sulfur", oxygenite is a natural alloy consisting of sulfur and solid oxygen. At low enough temperature and high enough pressure, oxygen solidifies around pure sulfur and assimilates it over an estimated time of seven months.#The resulting alloy bears the sky-blue color of solid oxygen dotted on the edge with yellowy sparks. Oxygenite is a miner’s favorite as it emits a small blue light when shaken.#However, it was discovered that the heat produced by these emissions could light up gas pockets. To prevent any potential injuries, the Emmets Consortium decided to ban the use of oxygenite as a handheld torch.

sulfur=Heavy sulfur is a highly toxic chemical found in large quantity near small planets' core. Bearing a reddish orange color, it can cause skin diseases as well as respiratory infections when in contact with living organisms. Despise its high melting point, Heavy Sulfur has been observed to spontaneously combust when exposed to water. It produces a blue flame reminiscent of the one created by the combustion of sulfur, hence its name, burning at incredible temperatures. Still used as fuel is some of the deepest parts of space, its potency was once one of the strongest available, making it a reliable and powerful source of energy. It has been replaced over time with other fuels, less dangerous and easier to handle.

platene=Rhoderinium has been discovered fairly recently. As it stands, scientists have yet to explain its origins and the extents of its use. Named after the star cluster of Rhode, where it was observed for the first time, it is supposed that Rhoderinium takes its unusual purple color from prolonged exposure to cosmic rays. Mistaken for amethyst for a long time, it peeked the scientific community's interest when an asteroid composed at 75% of pure Rhoderinium melted after entering a planet's atmosphere.#To some, it appears Rhoderinium cannot maintain its stability when in contact with oxygen. However, this claim is still highly debated among the scientific community.

object_building_uplinker=The hypersonic technology allows for long-distance emmet transporation, but cannot teleport heavy materials or inert resources.
object_building_stocker=When stored, the materials are immediatly transferred to the surface station using teleportation by low-frequency radio waves.#Such technology can only carry inert materials, but allows for transportation of heavy loads.
object_building_refinery=Laser cutters melt and slice the material simultaneously, making the refining process cheap and quick.
object_building_predeployed_battery=Cannot be produced : only bought.
object_building_powerplant=The power supply depends on the amount of fuel rods currently stored. Those fuel rods produce energy for a unlimited time, but can't be reused from one exploration to another.
object_building_stabilizer=Filtrates oxygen from near water and diffuses it in the cave to control pressure loss.
